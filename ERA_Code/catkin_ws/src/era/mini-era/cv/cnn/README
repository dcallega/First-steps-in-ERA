./main.o

Details:

Main.c contains the code for loading the dataset, training and testing.
Vector.c contains basic vector struct.
Preferences.c contains data like number of training images, number of test images which can be modified.
NeuralNetwork.c contains structs of the different aspects of neural networks like Neurons, Connections, Weights etc
MNistDoc.c contains advanced structs on how to perform backpropagation, training, testing etc.
